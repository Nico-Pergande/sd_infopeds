# Description
With sd_infopeds you can send information to your players. Whether a blip should be displayed on the map or not, you can determine for each position individually in the config.lua. This script offers e.g. new players the chance to learn important things about yours as soon as they arrive. It can also be used as an easteregg on the map, which users can find randomly.
